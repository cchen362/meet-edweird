"""
Scheduler service for Edward.

Runs an in-process asyncio loop that polls for due scheduled events
and executes them by invoking Edward's chat_with_memory() path.

Each event creates a new visible conversation (with title from event
description) so users can click the push notification to see Edward's
response. The [SCHEDULED EVENT] trigger message is filtered out in the
conversations router so only Edward's response is visible.
